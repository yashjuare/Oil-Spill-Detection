<b><u>Problem statement:</u></b> Detection of oil spills in vast ocean is an time consuming and inaccurate process. Most of the process is done by manual monitoring and satellite-based techniques which are often slow, prone to human error, and lack scalability.<br>
<hr>
<b><u>Project objectives:</u></b>Built a machine learning model with Convolutional Neural Network which can identify the oil spilled sites by reciving signals from satellite  <br>
