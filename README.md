<h3>Oil Spill Detection</h3>
<br>
<b>Problem statement:</b> Detection of oil spills in vast ocean is an time consuming and erroneous process. Most of the process is done by manual monitoring and satellite-based techniques which are often slow, prone to human error, and lack scalability.<br>
<b>Project objectives:</b>Built a machine learning model with Convolutional Neural Network which can identify the oil spilled sites by reciving signals from satellite  <br>
