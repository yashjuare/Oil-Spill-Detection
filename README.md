<h3>Oil Spill Detection</h3>
<b>Problem statement:</b> Traditional methods for oil spill detection, such as manual monitoring and satellite-based techniques, are often time-consuming, prone to human error, and lack scalability.<br>
<b>Project objectives:</b> an automated detection of oil on water using only thermal infrared images utilizing a CNN<br>
