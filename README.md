<b>Need of Project</b>
<p>
Oil spills pose a significant threat to marine ecosystems, human health, and coastal economies. Rapid and accurate detection of oil spills is essential to minimize environmental damage, reduce economic loss, and enable timely cleanup operations. Traditional methods of oil spill detection, such as manual visual inspection or radar analysis, often suffer from limitations including high operational costs, slow response times, and susceptibility to human error. With the advancement of remote sensing technologies, vast amounts of satellite and aerial imagery are now available, creating the need for automated and efficient image analysis techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a class of deep learning models specialized for image processing tasks, offer a powerful solution for this problem. CNNs can be use to automatically learn and extract complex features from image data, making them highly effective for detecting oil spills in diverse marine environments. By employing CNN-based models, oil spill detection can be performed in real-time or near-real-time, ensuring quicker response and reducing reliance on labor-intensive methods.</p>
